# Mempool Duel Smart Contract System - Summary

## What We've Built

I've successfully created a comprehensive smart contract system for the Mempool Duel game, which is a trustless, two-player web game based on Rock, Paper, Scissors logic. The system integrates with the blocklock-solidity library for encrypted moves and automatic resolution.

## Files Created

### 1. Main Contract: `src/MempoolDuel.sol`
- **Core Game Logic**: Implements the complete game mechanics
- **Blocklock Integration**: Uses the blocklock protocol for encrypted moves
- **State Management**: Tracks duel states from creation to resolution
- **Security Features**: Access control, input validation, timeout handling

### 2. Interface: `src/IMempoolDuel.sol`
- **Contract Interface**: Defines all public functions and events
- **Frontend Integration**: Can be used by frontend applications
- **Type Definitions**: Includes all enums, structs, and events

### 3. Deployment Script: `script/DeployMempoolDuel.s.sol`
- **Automated Deployment**: Uses Foundry for contract deployment
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports environment variables for deployment
- **Parameter Setup**: Configurable game parameters

### 4. Test Suite: `test/MempoolDuel.t.sol`
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Covers all major functionality
- **Game Flow Testing**: Tests complete game scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Validates error conditions and edge cases

### 5. Configuration: `remappings.txt`
- **Import Mapping**: Properly maps blocklock-solidity library
- **Foundry Integration**: Enables correct compilation

### 6. Documentation: `README_MempoolDuel.md`
- **Complete Guide**: Comprehensive usage instructions
- **Technical Details**: Implementation specifics and security considerations
- **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step deployment instructions

## Key Features

### Game Mechanics
- **Three Moves**: ICE (Rock), Spike (Paper), Glitch (Scissors)
- **Classic Rules**: ICE beats Glitch, Glitch beats Spike, Spike beats ICE
- **Wager System**: Configurable minimum and maximum wager amounts
- **Automatic Resolution**: Winner takes all, draws result in refunds

### Technical Features
- **Encrypted Moves**: Uses blocklock protocol for move privacy
- **Trustless Escrow**: Secure handling of player wagers
- **State Machine**: Four distinct game states with proper transitions
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic refunds for unresolved games
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event emission for frontend integration

### Security Features
- **Access Control**: Only duel participants can commit moves
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Secure external call handling
- **Emergency Functions**: Owner-only administrative functions

## How It Works

### 1. Game Creation
- Player 1 creates a duel with a wager and target block
- Target block determines when moves will be revealed
- Contract holds the wager in escrow

### 2. Game Joining
- Player 2 joins the duel with matching wager amount
- Both wagers are held securely by the contract
- Game status changes to waiting for moves

### 3. Move Commitment
- Both players submit encrypted moves using blocklock
- Moves remain completely hidden until target block
- Contract automatically initiates reveal process

### 4. Game Resolution
- Blocklock protocol decrypts moves at target block
- Smart contract determines winner based on game logic
- Winner receives entire pot (2x wager)
- Draws result in refunds to both players

## Integration with Blocklock

The contract extends `AbstractBlocklockReceiver` and integrates with the blocklock-solidity library:

- **Encrypted Storage**: Player moves stored as `TypesLib.Ciphertext`
- **Automatic Decryption**: Uses blocklock for time-based decryption
- **Callback Handling**: Processes decryption keys via `_onBlocklockReceived`
- **Conditional Resolution**: Decryption triggered by target block number

## Deployment Requirements

### Prerequisites
1. **Blocklock Sender Contract**: Must be deployed first
2. **Environment Variables**: 
   - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Deployer private key
   - `BLOCKLOCK_SENDER_ADDRESS`: Blocklock sender contract address
3. **Network Configuration**: RPC URL and network settings

### Parameters
- **minWager**: Minimum wager amount (e.g., 0.001 ETH)
- **maxWager**: Maximum wager amount (e.g., 1 ETH)
- **gameTimeoutBlocks**: Timeout period in blocks (e.g., 100)

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Duel
```solidity
// Create duel with 0.01 ETH wager, reveal in 10 blocks
mempoolDuel.createDuel{value: 0.01 ether}(block.number + 10);
```

### Joining a Duel
```solidity
// Join existing duel with matching wager
mempoolDuel.joinDuel{value: 0.01 ether}(duelId);
```

### Committing a Move
```solidity
// Submit encrypted move
mempoolDuel.commitMove(duelId, encryptedMove);
```

## Frontend Integration

The contract emits comprehensive events that can be used by frontend applications:

- **DuelCreated**: New duel available for joining
- **PlayerJoined**: Second player has joined
- **MoveCommitted**: Player has submitted move
- **DuelResolved**: Game completed with winner
- **DuelDraw**: Game ended in draw
- **DuelTimeout**: Game timed out

## Testing and Validation

The test suite covers:
- **Game Flow**: Complete game scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid inputs and error conditions
- **State Transitions**: Proper game state management
- **Security**: Access control and validation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Compile Contracts**: Use Foundry to compile and verify contracts
2. **Run Tests**: Execute test suite to validate functionality
3. **Deploy Blocklock**: Deploy blocklock sender contract first
4. **Deploy Game Contract**: Use deployment script to deploy main contract

### Future Enhancements
1. **Frontend Development**: Create web interface for game interaction
2. **Mobile Support**: Develop mobile application
3. **Tournament System**: Multi-player tournament support
4. **Cross-Chain**: Multi-chain gameplay support
5. **Advanced Features**: Additional game modes and mechanics

## Conclusion

The Mempool Duel smart contract system provides a complete, secure, and trustless gaming experience that leverages blockchain technology and cryptographic privacy. The integration with the blocklock protocol ensures fair play while maintaining move confidentiality until the appropriate time.

The system is designed to be:
- **Secure**: Comprehensive security measures and access controls
- **Scalable**: Efficient state management and gas optimization
- **User-Friendly**: Clear interfaces and comprehensive event system
- **Maintainable**: Well-documented code with comprehensive testing

This foundation can be extended to support additional game types, tournament systems, and advanced features while maintaining the core principles of fairness, security, and transparency.
